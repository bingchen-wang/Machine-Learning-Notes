    "Localization can generally not be exactly the same as the labelled location of bounding box. In order to evaluate the goodness of the localization, we employ the idea of **intersection over union** (IoU). It works by calculating the ratio of the intersection of two bounding boxes over their union. Generally speaking, an $$\\text{IoU} \\geq 0.5$$ is considered **correct localization**.\n",

To make sure that only one bounding box (the best one) is predicted for each object, the **non-max suppression algorithm** can be used. It works as follows:\n",

    "### Anchor Boxes\n",
    "While the chance of the midpoints of two objects falling into one grid is small with small grid cells, the **Anchor Boxes** algorithm has been invented to deal with this possibility. It works by pre-specifying a couple of anchor boxes of different shapes and then label the objects with an anchor box which has the **largest IoU** with the object bounding box.\n",
