    "#### Why does Batch Norm work?\n",
    "1. Similar to normalizing the input features (which makes the cost space less skewed and speeds up gradient descent), Batch Norm normalises values in the hidden units (which are inputs to the next layer).\n",
    "2. Bath Norm makes the weights of later layers more robust to changes to weights in earlier layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regularization effect of Batch Norm\n",
    "Batch normalization has a slight regularization effect. This is because:\n",
    "1. During the training time, we **compute the means and variances for each layer using only a single mini-batch at a time**, which  introduces noise to the statistics.\n",
    "2. Recall that the regularization effect of dropout comes from the **introduction of** multiplicative **noise** (in the form of $\\times \\; 0$ or $\\times \\; 1$). The regularization effect of Batch Norm comes from the introduction of both additive noise (from the mean) and multiplicative noise (from the variance).\n",
    "3. The smaller the variation of means and variances (across the mini-batches), the smaller the noise, and thus the smaller the regularization effect. Therefore, **a larger mini-batch size, say 512 instead of 256, has a smaller regularization effect**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Batch Norm at test time\n",
    "Need measures of $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^2$ for each layer to be used at training time. This is usually done by keeping **running averages** (expoentially weighted running averages) of $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^2$ at the training time. Note that the default approach is to estimate these averages but *not* use them in the training time. If one uses the running averages during the training time, the additional (backprop) feedback through $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^2$ would be smaller and thus the regularization effect. "
